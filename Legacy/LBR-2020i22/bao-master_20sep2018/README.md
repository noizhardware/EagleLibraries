## Cadsoft Eagle Libraries - mostly for audio applications

the "baoLegacy" folder contains previous versions, for backward compatibility

I created most of the footprints, some of them are edited versions of footprints from other sources.

### TODO: 
 * put "HE" suffix on footprints intended for use in home-etching, I stopped doing home-etching about an year ago, but someone could find them useful.
OR maybe transfer all home-etching-only footprints to a separate library, like baoHomeEtch.lbr
* split library into categories? like baoCONN for connectors, baoUI for user interface components, etc..

* I'm adding schematic symbols to packages, hopefully all packages are going to be complete devices
